    "\n",
    "**gpload** is a data loading utility that acts as an interface to the Greenplum Database external table parallel loading feature. Using a load specification defined in a YAML formatted control file, gpload executes a load by invoking the Greenplum Database parallel file server (*gpfdist*), creating an external table definition based on the source data defined, and executing an INSERT, UPDATE or MERGE operation to load the source data into the target table in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can declare more than one file as input/source as long as the data is of the same format in all files specified. Additionally, if the files are compressed using gzip or bzip2 (have a .gz or .bz2 file extension), the files will be uncompressed automatically (provided that `gunzip` or `bunzip2` is in your path). You can also declare options such as the schema of the source data files, perform basic transformations,  define custom delimiter and/or escape character(s), and many more. For the full list of available options, check the GPLoad Utility Reference available on [Pivotal Greenplum Database Documentation](https://gpdb.docs.pivotal.io/latest) (*Pivotal Greenplum Documentation* > *Utility Guide* > *Management Utility Reference* > *gpload*).\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation, including any SQL commands specified in the SQL collection of the YAML control file, are performed as a single transaction to prevent inconsistent data when performing multiple, simultaneous load operations on a target table.\n",

The video quality was barely adedquate and  DVD production was complicated and slow.  This is easy to use after exploring the menus.  Manual is difficult to read due to layout. Writing to disc takes little time and disc is finalized in seconds.  I used an external VCR to dub Barney videos.  I also tried internal dubbing procedure.  It works flawlessly but many of the videos are old and possibly dirty or corrupted so I didn't want to damage the internal VCR.  I have 346 tapes to archive so I prefer to wear out the external device which is less expensive to replace.  With it's multiple inputs and outputs especially HMDI it's versatile and well worth the purchase price.\t2015-02-25</td>\n",

There, I've got my songs classified in directories for artists, and then sub-directories for albums. And in that sub-dir I've got the picture of the album cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For pictures, I keep them in directories as Year-Month-Place, that way everybody at home can download their cameras/phones/etc. to the main backup disk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I transferred the files from that disk to the one I've placed in HD900B, keeping its own directory structure (all songs within the music dir, pictures at the images one). I.e.: \\music\\Lou Rawls\\Greatest Hits\\, or \\images\\2012-07 Seattle\\ .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the issues started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First to get the thing connected through USB or LAN to the PC. OK, eventually after a few on/offs, tries and errors, IP assignment, and a few hours of IT personnel, I've decided to connect the disk to my desktop PC and make the transfer straight from there. So, USB and LAN connection do not work straightforward, and the 8 pages leaflet called user manual does not tell a thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you have to generate a database (DB) of songs and images (and I guess video) files, which, it's lengthy, but OK, so be it, if the thing worked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Not recognizing jpg files. Can display jpg (picture) files when doing directory browsing, but it will not when access them through the multimedia database (to that, you have to press a big button that says MUSIC or PHOTOS, which is the very cool thing that made me buy this). For pictures it'll display invalid file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Then, one picture will randomly show, but not the others. Then you generate the multimedia database again, and pictures show up. But not all the directories and pictures stored in the hard drive. Then you'll try to add to the DB the directory of the pictures that are not shown or have been recently downloaded, and the pictures will not be added to the DB, and the other pictures will stop showing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Adding songs to the DB (by selecting \\\\\"only songs\\\\\", now will make the pictures disappear altogether. Arrrghhh!!!! I'm to wondering if it'll be easier if I learn Linux and write the firmware myself to get it working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I've mailed customer support (a day ago so I'm not saying anything about whether they responded quickly or not), but so far to me looks like the hardware is great, music plays great, you press a MENU button and can choose to display your songs by title, artist, or album, which I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, getting to display, update or look at pictures through the Multimedia DB is driving me nuts. However, maybe there's some trick, but it is certainly not documented in the \\\\\"user manual\\\\\".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I hope customer support will give an answer so I can modify this review and put the 5 stars I believe this hardware (not the firmware) deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should yo buy it? Skip it for the time being. Product is not ready. I'd been better off buying a cheap Netbook and looking for some multimedia player/DB software.\t2012-09-30</td>\n",

These symptoms appear intermittently but frequently and when they do appear, it takes a power cycle (on\\off) to correct.  And even with that it will most likely reappear within a few minutes.  The TV was purchased 8\\17\\2008 so well out of warranty I know.  But it is still very disappointing that the TV basically died in just 34 months of what may be at best 4 hours average use a day.  I have researched this issue online and have found that this same problem (bad T-CON board or LCD panel or both) is fairly common  in Sony LCD's and has resulted in hundreds of complaints and various ill received remedies (replacing with refurbished units that over time exhibit the same problems as the original) that fail to adequately address the problem.  The most logical conclusion is that the LCD panels and controller boards are defective or badly engineered or both.   The Sony brand used to mean quality and I have had excellent Sony CRT televisions that were the reference standard.  What happened?  After looking into this particular issue online, I don't think I will ever purchase another Sony TV and will caution others from doing so.  $1,200 is just too much to spend every three years on replacement TV's.\t2011-06-15</td>\n",

My goal is to have something that is compact, stored all my movies, home videos (HD videos , .mts files), photos and play it back whenever I want to.  I don't like burning DVDs and BR discs are expensive.  With this I may never have to burn another disc again.  I used the 1TB HD for stuff I want to watch...but I do have an external HD 2TB for all my files.      It took me a while to organize the way I want things (important to learn how to organize folders so you can find your way around), and dumped it into the HD.  It does took a long time to upload everything into it.  But once I got my 500GB of data onto it, man, it's nice to just turn it on and watch movies, home videos in HD and listening to music.      People complained about organization: learn to create folders and organize yourself. Ex.  Videos:  Home Movies\\2010\\March\\(all your march videos).  Or Videos: Movies\\(all your movies).  I even dumped all my Karaoke dvds into the 1Tb HD.  And it's capable of playing them exactly like a DVD player does.  Now I can sing my heart out.    I hope they allow us to remove the 1TB HD in there and upgrade it to 2TB...but for now the 1TB is still more than enough.    Streaming videos like netflix, youtube and stuff like that are great.    My problem was that I have some DV avi files that isn't compatible with the unit, so I have to convert those into Divx or other video format.  My \\\\\"HD files works great...put all the files in one folder, select the folder and it plays everything in the folder.  I don't like the 2-3 seconds in between files but hey, you can combine the files using your computer if you want.  (Reason for -1 star)\t2011-01-18</td>\n",

A LOT longer than in my previous printer (HP Officejet 6500). My math says it only costs me 2¢ per sheet for ink! For those who would crunch the numbers, the only cost that matters is the cost per sheet.&lt;br /&gt;Also - In spite of some contrary reviews - These are genuine HP ink cartridges, bundled together.

I had already threw out the packaging material after i purchased it. I never intended to return it, i wished i had not thrown it out cause this would've def been returned.&lt;br /&gt;I am pretty fluid when it comes to using gadgets so By no way is this any fault on my part this is just a really crappy product.

I replaced black the next day and then printed pages came out blank while copied pages printed perfectly.  I discarded that cartridge and tried a new black.  Still no ink on printed pages.    Update:  I originally posted this review on September 9th and gave the product 3 stars.  Today (September 23rd) I figured out that the ink was not the problem.  Another customer explained that I should just clean the ink heads.  I just pressed a couple buttons on my machine and now everything is working properly once again.  Since I already returned the ink I can not accurately rate this product.  I can, however, give 5 stars for the initial success of the magenta and yellow which worked perfectly.\t2014-09-09</td>\n",

Recent update not only speeds up operation, it also provides user interface enhancements. Strengthens my 5 star review of this system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this product 5 stars for amazing potential and the ability to serve a need that was previously unimaginable.  With that said I have two warnings:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Do not buy this product if your computer is slow and you plan to scan large books. If you plan to scan 200+ pages, you should have a fast computer.&lt;br /&gt;  2. Do not buy this product if you do not have patience and a willingness to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did you ever think you could scan a 500 page book in a matter of a couple hours?  Once you have gotten the hang of this wonder, you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE:&lt;br /&gt; 1. Use Auto mode - manual mode is buggy and will result in inferior pictures.  Auto mode lets you know when the picture will be good. Use the proper orientation and Document mode as well. These things matter.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Make sure to angle the camera at about 45 degrees to avoid glare reflection. You can take a picture in a dark room thanks to the built in auto flash, but it requires you to angle otherwise you may get unreadable images from glare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is amazing.  I had a 500 page textbook that I could not find any digital purchase route to go with.  I had a crazy idea, \\\\\"maybe I can scan the book and read it on my Nexus 7 FHD\\\\\".  A quick amazon search, and WOW there is something. I ordered it thinking it won't work... and for a few days I thought I was right and was just about to return it when I finally decided to watch the demo videos and learn.  I don't regret it now because I have a beautiful 500 Page PDF of my text.  It took a ton of work to get the hang of, but the results are great.  When used properly, it crops, automatically adjusts the angle of the page, and just generally takes great shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My requests for improvement in next generations:&lt;br/&gt;  #1 get rid of the velcro strap... it's just annoying and tacky to an otherwise beautifully made product.&lt;br /&gt;  #2 work on stabilizing and improving performance of the PerfeCapture code.  it's amazing magic but at the same time needs to be cleaned up as far as performance and stability. Bring the joy to all users, regardless of CPU strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making this dream possible!\t2014-01-13</td>\n",

You must 'carefully' back it out.  However, today, using the proper weight paper, it took in four sheets.

The old software was difficult to use because it would revert to 200 dpi and black and white, and you had to reconfigure every time, and then there is duplex or not, size of paper etc. etc. etc. Now it defaults to 300 dpi, automatically is set for 14&amp;#34; paper and duplex. It senses the shorter paper, and whether it is duplex/both sides or not and has turned this into one fully automated machine. I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE ANY SETTINGS = FULLY AUTOMATED. IT works great in my Windows 10 machine. Driver and software are available on their site. Just Google it, and it is all for free. Now a little box shows up in the bottom corner of your screen. It's a breeze. You still have to be careful when loading the paper, and I have found with a stack of 25 it will take two sheets somewhere along the line. So keep it down to 5 to 10 on a single shot. Love the machine now. End of update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me say that I decided a year and a half ago to go all digital. You know the boxes start to pile up in the basement or attic of how many years do you really need to go back with your records? The answer to that is vague no matter what source you try. So I thought why not digitize everything, and do regular backups, even to an outbound device such as a removable hard drive/USB drive for safe keeping. So for the past two years I have been using the [[ASIN:B005IIR8H2 Epson WorkForce Pro WP-4540 Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer, Copier, Scanner, Fax (C11CB33201)]] and delighted that I can stack up a year's worth of for example credit card statements and it will scan all of them, and convert to PDF files. The only problem is the amount of time it takes in order to do that. So the dream of being able to go through all of the old boxes, and completely shred them after scanning had this major obstacle of the amount of time it would take to do all of that. It was fine when working in the current year, but going through the archives is a job I have been putting on hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then along comes this Xerox DocuMate 3125 that scans 25 pages per minute, or 44 pages per minute in duplex, in black and white, grayscale, or color. You just set it up the way you want it, hit one button and Wow everything just flies through. At the factory default 200 dpi setting it allows for some shadows on the scan, but just by increasing this to 300 dpi you get no shadows and an all original level of quality. The speed at the 300 dpi setting doesn't seem to be affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So with the 50 page automatic document feeder capability you can load in a whole year worth of statements, and scan them both sides all automatically, and in a flash. The advantage of this is in the filing system. I just have them scanned directly into that accounts folder. So let's say I have a Citibank Folder, and then I create a sub-folder with just the last 4 digits of the account number, and then they year becomes a sub folder to that. So it looks like this for example, Citibank\\5138\\2012. So the entire years worth of scans goes right into the 2012 folder for that account, and yes each page is a separate PDF, so if you want you can go back in and rename them for each month, or just let it be, and if you sorted them according to date, the proper month would be easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the comments about a learning curve for the software. Doesn't every feature rich software contain a certain amount of a learning curve to it? Xerox wrote the book on scanning and the software suite included with this scanner is second to none. Just because someone doesn't want to become familiar with it and would rather use the old tried and true that they are already familiar with is no reason to bash this incredible software suite. Xerox knows how to produce a Mickey Mouse version for toddler to use but they are the king of office scan, print, sort, organize. Yes I spent a little time learning the tricks to getit to do what I wanted it to specifically, but fortunately every option was there. Yes there are four different software suites to load. Is that a problem? With today's hard drive capacity for such a little bit of money you would think everyone would be delighted at having so much functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other big advantage to this is it is so small, and the bottom tray flips up, and the top folds down making it such a compact unit that it sits conveniently on your desk. You could sum it up in two words, small and powerful. Due to the incredibly small footprint enabling you to keep it desktop you don't need a big LCD screen on the unit with a lot of outbound programming functions, it all happens on the PC right alongside it. Can you tell I love this thing? There are several function buttons on it, one allows you to select numerically 1 of 9 pre-sets on a well lit up blue numerical indicator area with a simple up and down arrow on it, as well as having a &amp;#34;Simplex&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Duplex&amp;#34; buttons and a power on-off switch. Everything else is done through the PC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you can fine tune the way you prefer to scan on the PC, and save up to 9 user presets, and access them right from the control panel with a simple up and down arrow, with a large well lit numeric number and then hit one button for your scan. So the idea of not having a big control panel on the outbound unit so you can do custom programming work while standing up is a mute one.&lt;br /&gt;You may think okay this thing flies and after reading my comment about the 200 dpi setting you may think this is a super duty fast industrial grade scanner, but what I also want to emphasize is that with the software package that is included you have a lot more features, and this thing will scan documents at high resolutions and overall sizes as well; however while it is recording every little nuance on a micro-scale it takes time to do that as well. That requires a lot of passes on the scanning head. So yes it does the super critical stuff as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to emphasize all that this does with the included software suite, and since it is not placed on this Amazon page as of the day of this review, I want to copy and paste what Zerox displays as their individual software functions. Believe me with all of these kinds of capabilities I don't mind spending an extra 15 minutes loading the software which it all does automatically for you.

Bought it because we do a lot of long car rides and our car is older and doesn't have a dvd player already installed in it. And with 2 little ones, it's important to keep them entertained. The first time we used it, the dvd player only worked for 2 hrs (the length of a movie) and that was it. I used the car charger and nothing. I ended up having to buy a car adapter to put the regular plug into the car adapter and it worked fine for maybe 4  more road trips. Then I don't know if its the voltage on the dvd or what, but the car adapter burned out and now the two voltage plug ins in the truck don't work. The dvd player will work for 2 hrs after being charged but that's it. So for short car rides this will work without plugging it in. For the price, you get what you paid for. What sold me was the swivel action and the fact that it takes a usb drive. We had movies loaded on it\t2015-02-08</td>\n",

I got over this pretty quickly because once &amp;#34;casting&amp;#34; to the Chromecast, battery life on one's device isn't impacted as terribly as I initially expected. Still, I made sure to place charging cables near my comfiest movie-watching-chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, we quickly found performance to be a real problem. After a chunk of time watching Netflix, the stream would start to stutter continuously or until the audio and video were completely de-synced.  This happened about 50% of the time while the Chromecast and connected device were less than fifteen feet from the router.  Stopping and re-initializing the stream did nothing to solve the problem, but merely delay it another few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, after the most recent Chromecast update (writing this as of 5/7/2014), our ability to stream Plex (the sole purpose we didn't return it after the Netflix issues popped up) was completely obliterated by freezing issues that would happen every six-to-eight seconds and last about ten seconds each - a buffering that would never quite buffer, if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good number of web-dwelling trolls would point to network signal strength or the ability of one's PC to transcode properly (Chromecast will only watch one format - it's everything else's job to transcode properly to that format, leaving lots of places for various updates to break things down), however neither were true culprits.  More likely, as some diligent users discovered, the problem was caused by Chromecast firmware updates rolled out universally for the European hardware release - they appear to have made it decidedly more difficult to work with AES network encryption.  Well, the router provided by my ISP has three options: AES, AES + TKIP, and none.  Therefore, if I want my network encrypted, AES has to be enabled one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Chromecast two stars for being somewhat useful and doing the job of more expensive devices in a cheaper way (provided you have a smartphone, tablet, or PC, ya' caveman), but it did neither of the things I needed it to do (advertised features, no less) in an acceptable way.  With the addition of apparently rolling out an update that worsened performance for many (only Apple is afforded the luxury of being allowed to ruin their customers' devices), I decided it had to go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put it simply, it doesn't do what it says it does.  Not for me. :-\\, AES has to be enabled one way or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the Chromecast two stars for being somewhat useful and doing the job of more expensive devices in a cheaper way (provided you have a smartphone, tablet, or PC, ya' caveman), but it did neither of the things I needed it to do (advertised features, no less) in an acceptable way.

ZERO Support!\tI wrote a review for the Evolution Kit and my horrible experience that followed after trying to install it.  I'll just cut and paste from that review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6\\6\\2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So.....after having this device for a few days I came to discover that my TV wouldn't turn on. Press the power button and I hear a click come from the TV (normal) but then you hear another click right away and the TV remains off. I figured the last thing I did to my TV was install the evolution kit so I removed it and my TV turns on again. Install the kit and again the TV would not turn on. So this unit is now dead. It also seems to have killed my TV because now my RVU client will not work. Any content I play from my genie DVR will play for about 10 seconds then the entire TV will just freeze. So now my evolution kit and TV are dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Samsung support and the person I chatted with was completely useless. The end result was my case being escalated to someone else and I was told they would be contacting me in 2-3 days. Yeah, that was OVER A WEEK AGO. I contacted them again and was told to keep waiting, they'll get to me when they get to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the device was great when it worked. However in the end it ruined my TV and I'm now left sitting in the dark with zero support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All stars removed for having the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Also if this device has the ability to physically harm the TV itself then it's just not worth it in my opinion. If they stood by their product and responded to service then ok, but they don't and now I'm screwed. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some books to buy since TV is not on my todo list anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6\\11\\2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of waiting I contacted Samsung again and raised hell! They basically told me there was nothing they could do for me. They simply did not have anyone available to help me. That is complete garbage! So they redirected me to a local TV shop andtold me to have them fix it. Since it was under warranty they would have to handle it. So now I have to drive 40 miles round trip (probably twice) to get this sorted out with someone else. They didn't even set me up with them. Just gave me a number and told me to call them and to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first and last time I will ever be a Samsung customer. Vizio treats their customers much better and with a lot more respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 6\\19\\2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contacted the TV Shop that Samsung told to me to deal with and they refuse to help me. They said they wont touch the evolution kit at all and since I installed the evolution kit then my broken TV is my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still no response from Samsung at all! Called them again and again I was told there is nothing they can do. They will get to me then they get to me. Told them about my experience with the 3rd party vendor and they couldn't care less. So now I've had a dead TV and a dead evolution kit for over 3 weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Samsung is a joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 07/9/2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY got my TV fixed. That only took what? 7 WEEKS!!!! Not to mention a whole lot of upset calls to Samsung. However, I still have a broken Evolution kit. They keep bouncing me around from department to department because no one knows anything about this product. Two people told me, after I gave them the model number (SEK-1000), that it was NOT a Samsung model number. Then another person told me that the serial number I gave them was no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow....just....wow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no worries, someone will call me in 2-3 days.....someone just shoot me now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 08/15/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY!!!! After 10 weeks Samsung has finally sent me a replacement. Installed it and everything seems fine again.....for now. Oh, btw...no one ever called me 2-3 days later. I got the replacement after 2 more phone calls that I had to make. Like I said before, this is my last Samsung product, ever! If this thingbreaks again then I'm getting rid of it. Hell, I might sell it right now as every time I look at it I get a bad taste in my mouth.\t2013-06-19</td>\n",

We wanted traditional paging on top of the flexibility of paging to our guests via cell phone.    The traditional paging has tested as expected and advertised...no problems there...kudos to the LRS folks.    The LRS web site is not as informative as I would like, but especially on the matter of additional functionality with cell phones.  After much time surfing, without being more careful in due diligence, it looks like the cell-phone paging requires an additional monthly fee, of which I don't mind, provided that pricing was more clearly explained and detailed, but not obvious when making this purchase to the upgraded transmitter.  (Compared to the transitter/coaster system perhaps more typically purchased.)  I have yet to find a clear on-line explanation of subscription practices of LRS, as of this time.    Bottom line, I did not catch additional issues in this research before purchase - so hopefully this review will save some folks a bit of time, or at least have them consider the additional issue of a subscription.  We will move forward with this product...hopefully, the service is tiered toward various usage formats, and we will be able to purchase the package which fits our small-business format...otherwise, we'll have to stick to basic paging practices.    The low-star rating is based mostly towards not making it fully clear the cell-paging feature is an additional cost, and at what cost.  I really don't mind...just wish more upfront as to such.  The general paging via coasters should work fine.    Suggestion to the LRS folks...at least send back to the terminal a message as to the subscription charge when performing a cell-phone transaction, if not already a customer for the extended service - at least I would have wasted a little less time assuming I was doing something wrong in setup.      \\\t2011-08-26</td>\n",

The most noticable was the keyboard. The keys are simply too close. I make considerable use of my phone's keyboard for email, document creation/notes, and texting. I suppose that I've been spoiled by my Tmobile Sidekicks (I owned SK 1's, II's, III's, and the Sidekick LX. I found that the keyboard on the G1 was not nearly as useable. Yes, one can type if you have small fingers but with the G1 and other keyboard phones, you are usually \\\\\"typing on the go\\\\\" with your thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did really like the video and the wi-fi connections make the G1 really fly. However, due to the limited G3 connections Tmobile offers, I ended up on Edge speed connections when away from my wi-fi. This slower speed simply could not give the smooth uninterrupted connectivity the G1 is capable of running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have kept the G1 if the keyboard was more functional and the G3 network was more available. The G1 certainly delivered on graphics, and media though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up returning the G1 to Tmobile and returned to my faithful Sidekick.  :\\\t2009-01-27</td>\n",

The problem is with the jack.  Not being a particularly technical person, I didn't know there's a difference between a jack with two black lines on it and one with three black lines (something to do with mono versus stereo? not sure).  Anyway, this headset comes with a jack with two black lines (and so did the adapter I got), but my phone will only work with a jack with *three* black lines.  Not sure how I could have known that.  So, it's possible this headset would work fine with a phone that is compatible with a two-black-line jack, but mine is not.  I'll change my rating from 1 to 2 stars, but the bottom line for me is that it still doesn't work with my phone (and never could), and I had to buy a different headset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it's comfortable, but no one can hear me.  I've tried it with calls to land lines, cell phones, conference numbers, and nobody can ever hear me on the other end of the call.  So instead of being able to type notes or multitask, I end up unplugging the darn thing and proceeding with my cell phone tucked awkwardly between my ear and my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I had to get an adapter in order to use the headset, which I purchased at Radio Shack, and I suppose it's possible that the problem is with the adapter rather than the headset.  But I have no way to test that, and either way, the headset is useless to me.  :\\\t2013-01-26</td>\n",

The side of the screen that goes against the tablet attracts dust like a magnet. I had the first one on, but had about 4 particles of dust. I was able to live with it for a week or so but tried the other two and was unable to get them on without all the bubbles and dust. Once a piece of dust gets on the screen it is curtains, it will not come off. The only way is to find a dust free area and since I do not have a bubble to get in to install this I have yet to find a dust free area in the great Memphis area. I will say the anti fingerprint and anti glare part of the product worked very well, I just couldn't get any of the three installed without dust. I bought the CCM screen protector and installed it without issues. No bubbles, no dust. It is not quite as good against finger prints but the anti glare on it is about the same and again no dust under the screen. It cost 19.96 but it worked\t2012-06-28</td>\n",

Not only do they drastically reduce glare, but almost completely eliminate finger prints and smudges.  I couldn't be more pleased.  Tips.  I've used screen savers on all my gear and none are easy to install.  The fact that our Tabs are fairly large makes it an even greater challenge.  Lining up any screen saver has always been a bit hard for me.  And DUST is your enemy.  After miss-aligning the first one and getting two specs of dust here's what I did.    First, notice the small amount of silver frame that can be seen around the GT.  If you allow any part of the screen saver to rest on that frame it will not lay down properly.  This happened to me on my first one.  So I found by pulling the first layer back (as per instructions) about one-third then starting at the bottom right corner I was able to carefully get the alignment right.  After getting about 3 or 4 inches of the saver up each side (enough so it would stay in place) and seeing it was lined up, I pulled the first layer off allowing the saver to fall in place.  Don't worry about any bubbles that may show at first.  Using a credit card (one with little or no balance worked better for me than.... well those others) I worked the bubbles out.  A few took some patience but I managed to end up without any.  Just remember that dust is your enemy and time seems to attract dust.  So don't work too slowly.\t2011-12-16</td>\n",

So for her birthday, I tried to get her a gift that could somehow begin to repay her.  Since gift cards are bushleague gifts, I tried to think of something different.  Enter this footrest.  Our office has furniture from the seventies, before \\\\\"ergonomics\\\\\" was actually a word, and her desk requires her to sit with her feet dangling in order to type.  So it's either ankle problems or carpal tunnel.  This footrest worked perfectly to update her office space into something that doesn't immediately prompt a call from OSHA.  It adjusts in every way imaginable.  The one downside is that moving the height is a bit of a pain, and as others have pointed out, the instructions are not exactly detailed -- in fact they are just brightly colored pictures.  That being said, it works, and she loves the gift.  So if you are trying to find a gift with utility for that special someone who keeps you organized (read: employed), this wouldn't be a bad one (note:  a good campanion gift is a well-deserved raise).\t2011-11-09</td>\n",

I use mine as my alarm clock, and I love waking up to it, and being able to choose my sound.    You can easily sit for and hour or two just switching the pieces around and finding new combinations, and the light show looks great, and it makes a great portable speaker for my mp3 player.    My only grief was with the recordable cube. I don't know if I'm the only one with this problem, but to record on the cube you must press and hold the mode and up button. Unfortunately, these buttons are so ill defined that I cannot seem to hold them, and by pressing both at the same time, I seem to actually be just pushing them randomly. I've heard the \\\\\"Begin\\\\\" message a couple times, but it has never actually let me record.    On the whole, this thing is excellent, but I really wish the cube were easier to record. As is, I just threw mine away. :\\\t2007-08-07</td>\n",

It was only $25, but for even that much it shoud have lasted longer than 2.5 months.  I've loved Uniden in the past, but those have always been their more expensive models which all have great sound quality and have lasted years.  This model was purchased merely because I am living away from home for several months and decided my cell phone just wasn't cutting it so I decided to get a home line and an inexpensive phone with an answering machine.
